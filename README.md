## Motivation
- I wanted to learn ember.js and ember-data ... but wanted to see more than console.log('hello world')

## To run this django application

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python manage.py runserver
- http://localhost:8000

## To run the jasmine unit tests

- npm install
- node node_modules/jasmine-phantom-node/bin/jasmine-phantom-node codecamp/static/script/tests
